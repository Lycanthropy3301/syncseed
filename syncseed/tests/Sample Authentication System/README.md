# Syncseed - Sample Authentication Example

## Usage

1. Run the server in the Server directory:

   ```bash
   cd Source
   python main.py
   ```

2. Run one of the authentication programs included in either user directories:

   ```bash
   cd User1_Dir
   python auth.py
   ```

Follow the on-screen prompts to enter a username and password. The client will communicate with the server, and the server's response will be displayed.

**passwords are included in Users.txt in the server directory**

## Configuration
