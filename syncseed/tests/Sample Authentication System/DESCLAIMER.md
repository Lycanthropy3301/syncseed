**Disclaimer: This Example is for Educational Purposes Only**

The authentication system included in this example is intended solely for educational purposes to showcase the basic functionality of Syncseed. It is not suitable for deployment in a production environment.

### Important Points:

1. **Lack of Security Measures:**
   - This example lacks essential security measures such as encryption, rate limiting, password hashing, and access control.
   - Using this example in a production system without implementing these security practices may expose your application to vulnerabilities.

2. **Educational Purpose:**
   - The primary purpose of this example is to demonstrate the integration of Syncseed into a basic authentication system.
   - It does not adhere to best practices for security and should not be considered a secure implementation.

3. **Production System Recommendations:**
   - In a production environment, always follow industry-standard security practices.
   - Implement encryption for data in transit, securely hash passwords, enforce rate limiting to prevent abuse, and employ proper access controls.

4. **Use at Your Own Risk:**
   - Any use of this example in a production system is at your own risk.
   - It is highly recommended to consult with security professionals and follow established security guidelines when implementing authentication systems in real-world applications.

### Secure Your Production System:

To ensure the security of your production system, you should consider referring to the 'Syncseed Deployment Guide' on my [github](https://github.com/Lycanthropy3301/syncseed)

Remember, the example provided here serves educational purposes only, and users are strongly advised to adopt better security practices in a production environment.
